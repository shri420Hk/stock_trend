Stock Trend Prediction using LSTM
This repository contains Python code for predicting stock trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Weâ€™ll use historical stock price data to train the model and make predictions.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas_datareader
matplotlib
scikit-learn
yfinance
keras
You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas_datareader matplotlib scikit-learn yfinance keras
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-trend-prediction.git
cd stock-trend-prediction
Run the stock_trend_prediction.py script:
bash
Copy code
python stock_trend_prediction.py
Enter the stock symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) when prompted.
The script will download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, preprocess it, and train an LSTM model.
The trained model will predict future stock prices based on the input data.
Results
The script will display a plot showing historical stock prices and the predicted trend.
